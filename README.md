Implemented the game mechanics such as snake movement, food generation, and collision detection
The snake grows upon eating food, and the speed increases, making the game progressively more challenging
Designed user input handling for direction control, and integrated logic to detect collisions with walls or the snakeâ€™s body
Utilized Windows-specific libraries for console display and interaction
Built with object-oriented programming principles and tested for performance on different configurations
